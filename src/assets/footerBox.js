The only thing I'd change is having the option to get specific sizes for use in advertising where I need 4-5 variations. The sizes at the time that were offered are just horizontal, square, vertical, but I need to be exact with my measurements.",

The quality of the AI blew me away, as I never use these features because from my experience they are always just BAD. The technology doesnt work yet and the results are... not good :) In case of adcreative the AI tool is saving me so much time and I use these designs to deliver advertisements for my clients who are promoting 6 and 7 figure businesses. That means these designs work and can run a business, can't tell that about any other app.",
